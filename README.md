## General info
Introducing the new Android app designed to streamline task management within your organization. With this app, clients can easily create new tasks and assign them to workers who are available to complete the job.


The app has an intuitive interface that allows clients to create a task by providing a title, description, deadline, and any other relevant details. Once a task is created, it is then sent to the admin who can assign it to an available worker with the necessary skills and experience.
